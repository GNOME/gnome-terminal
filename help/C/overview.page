  <title>Overview of a terminal</title>

  <p><app>Terminal</app> is a terminal program for <gui>GNOME</gui>. The
  following terms and their descriptions will help you to be familiar with
  <app>Terminal</app> and its capabilities.</p>

      <title>A terminal</title>
      <p>A terminal is a text input point in a computer. It is also referred to as a Command
      Line Interface (CLI).</p>

      <title>Physical terminals</title>
      <p>IBM 3270, VT100 and many others are hardware terminals that are no
      longer produced as physical devices. To emulate these terminals, there are
      terminal emulators.</p>

      <title>Terminal emulators</title>
      <p>Emulation is the ability of a computer program to imitate another
      program or device.</p>

      <p>A terminal emulator (TTY) is a software program that emulates
      a video terminal in modern computers that use graphical user interfaces
      and provide interactive access to applications that run only in the
      command line environments. These applications may be running either on the
      same machine or on a different one via <app>telnet</app>, <app>ssh</app>,
      or <app>dial-up</app>.</p>

      <title>VTE</title>
      <p>Virtual Terminal Environment (VTE) is a terminal emulator which
      emulates a text terminal inside a graphical user interface (GUI)
      environment. <app>Terminal</app> is largely based on the <app>VTE</app>.
      <app>VTE</app> has widgets that implement a fully functional terminal
      emulator.</p>

      <title>Shell</title>
      <p>A <em>shell</em> is a program that provides an interface to invoke or
      “launch” commands or programs within a terminal. It also allows you
      to view and browse the contents of directories. Popular shells include
      <app>bash</app>, <app>zsh</app>, and <app>fish</app>.</p>

      <title>Escape Sequences</title>
      <p>An escape sequence is a series of characters used to change the meaning
      of data in a terminal. Escape sequences are used when a computer has only
      a single channel to send information back and forth. Escape sequences are
      used to distinguish if data being sent is a command to be executed or
      information to be stored and displayed.</p>

      <title>Prompt</title>
      <p>A prompt, also referred to as a <em>command prompt</em>, is a sequence of
      characters used in the command line environment to indicate the readiness
      of the shell to accept commands.</p>

      <p>A prompt usually ends with characters <sys>$</sys>, <sys>%</sys>,
      <sys>#</sys> or <sys>&gt;</sys> and includes path
      information about the present working directory. On Unix based
      systems, it is common for the prompt to end in a <sys>$</sys> or 
      <sys>#</sys> character depending on the user role such as <sys>$</sys>
      for user and <sys>#</sys> for superuser (also called <sys>root</sys>).
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>Command</title>
      <p>An input entered in the prompt to be executed is called a
      <em>command</em>. It is a combination of the program name along with any
      other additional parameters passed as flags to alter the execution of the
      program.</p>

  # Note that vte isn't on this list; gnome-terminal needs to
  # build vte itself (since it cannot rely on the distro to
  # have an adequate version), which is done as a meson
  # subproject. Therefore the build dependencies of vte also
  # need to be on this list.
  # This image is also shared between master and gtk3 branches,
  # so add both gtk3 and gtk4-based dependencies.
